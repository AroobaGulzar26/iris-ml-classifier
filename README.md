# Iris ML Classifier 🌸

This is my first Machine Learning project using the classic Iris dataset.  
It classifies flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica using a supervised ML algorithm.

## 📂 Project Description

- 📊 Used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
- 🔍 Model: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- 🧠 Accuracy: ~97% on test set

## 📌 Features
- Data loading and visualization
- KNN model training & evaluation
- Accuracy check and predictions

## 🚀 How to Run
Open the .ipynb notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.
